The Help Desk is designed for efficient support ticket management. It allows you to configure support team settings, define issue statuses and types, and manage support tickets through their lifecycle.

**Support Team Configuration**

* Accessible via `Organisation Settings` -> `Support`.
* You can add and manage support team members who will handle and be notified of support tickets.
* Toggle notifications for each team member to ensure the right people are alerted.

**Issue Statuses**

* Customize the workflow of a support ticket by defining statuses like "To do", "In Progress", and "Waiting List".
* Order the statuses to establish the ticket flow from creation to resolution.
