The Roles section within Organization Settings is a powerful feature that allows for the customisation of user responsibilities and access within the platform. Below is an outline for documentation purposes:

**Roles Section Overview:**

1. **Custom Role Creation:** Navigate to Organisation Settings, then to Features, and select Roles to begin creating custom roles tailored to the needs of your organization.
2. **Role Assignment Levels:** Custom roles can be assigned at various levels:
   * **User Type:** Defines the general category of users such as volunteers, staff, or administrators.
   * **Local Group:** Applicable if this feature is enabled; it is useful for providing access specific to local groups within the organization.
   * **Parent Local Center:** If enabled, it acts as an umbrella for multiple local groups, and roles assigned here affect all underlying local groups.
   * **Organisation Level:** Roles assigned at this level apply across the entire organization, providing a broad scope of permissions.
3. **Custom Permissions:** Each role comes with a set of permissions that can be customized. You can select from a variety of permissions such as Admin, Financial, HR, etc., to define the exact capabilities of the role at its respective level.
4. **Scope of Permissions:** Depending on where the role is applied—whether at the local center level, organization level, or otherwise—the user's permissions will be adjusted accordingly. For instance, a role with financial permissions at the local group level will have access to financial details pertinent to that group only.
5. **Role Management:** Administrators can easily update or remove roles as needed through the same 'Roles' section, allowing for dynamic management as the organization evolves.

This structure ensures a flexible and hierarchical approach to user management, providing clear delineation of responsibilities and maintaining the integrity of the organization's operations.
