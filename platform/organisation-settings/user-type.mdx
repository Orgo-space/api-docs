User Types are customizable [roles](/platform/roles) that can be assigned to members of your organization. These roles help to define access levels, [permissions](/platform/../users/system-roles), and the visibility of content specific to each member's involvement with the organization.

**Tips for using User Types:**

* Be clear: Name roles based on what people will do in your org.
* Keep it simple: Give roles only the access they need.
* Check regularly: Update roles to fit how your org changes.

With User Types, you can make sure everyone has the right access for their part in your community.
