   * Click on 'New Group' in the sidebar menu to start the creation process.
2. **Naming:**
   * Provide a name for the group that clearly identifies its purpose or members.
3. **Privacy Settings:**
   * Choose 'Private' to ensure that the group is not open for any community member to join without an invitation.
4. **Features Selection:**
   * Toggle on the features you want to include in your group:
     * Issues: For tracking and managing group-specific concerns or tasks.
     * Events: To organize events exclusive to the group.
     * Discussions: For private communication and discussions within the group.
     * Files: To share and manage files privately within the group.

   * Configure the 'Issues' section by enabling functionalities such as:
     * Priority: To assign urgency levels to tasks or topics.
     * Due Date: To set deadlines for issue resolution.
     * Type: To categorize issues for better organization and handling.
6. **Finalizing Group Creation:**
   * After setting up the group's features and functionalities, click 'Save' to create the group.

**Adding Members to a Private Group:**

* Once the private group is created, the group creator or designated administrators can invite other community members to join.
* Invitations can be sent directly to users, and only those who are invited can view and participate in the group.

**Best Practices:**

* Be clear and specific when naming your group to avoid confusion.
* Only enable the features that are necessary for the group's purpose to keep the group environment focused and efficient.
* Regularly manage the group's membership to ensure that all participants are active and relevant to the group's objectives.

**Note:** Private Groups are designed to provide members with a focused and exclusive environment for specific collaborations within the Orgo community. Proper management and usage of these groups can lead to effective and productive outcomes.
