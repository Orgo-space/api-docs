  * Contacts can be edited at any time by clicking the 'Edit' option associated with their entry.

**Importing and Exporting Contacts:**

* **Importing Contacts:**
  * Import contact details in bulk by using the CSV import feature. This is particularly useful when migrating contacts from another system or after events such as conferences where new contacts are acquired.
* **Exporting Contacts:**
  * For external use or backup purposes, contacts can be exported as a CSV file. This export function allows for easy data manipulation and integration with other marketing or CRM tools.

**Best Practices:**

* Always obtain and record consent before adding new contacts or sending out newsletters.
* Regularly update contact details to ensure communication channels are current and accurate.
* Utilize import and export functions to streamline contact management and ensure consistency across platforms.
