The Permissions tab is a centralised control panel where administrators can manage and customise the access levels of each community member. This is essential for maintaining the security and efficiency of the platform. Below is an overview for documentation purposes:

**Permissions Overview:**

1. **Access Rights:** Define what a member can see and do within the platform. This includes access to certain files, the ability to post in discussions, and the management of events.
2. **Role Assignment:** Assign roles to members, such as 'Trainer' or 'Moderator', which come with predefined permissions that align with their responsibilities within the community.
3. **Custom Permissions:** For nuanced control, administrators can set custom permissions for individual members or groups, tailoring access to the unique needs of the organization.
4. **Permission Groups:** Members can be added to permission groups that streamline the process of managing access for members with similar roles or needs.
5. **Audit Logs:** Track changes to permissions to ensure transparency and accountability within the organization.

When updating permissions, it's important to review changes carefully to prevent unintended access or restrictions.
