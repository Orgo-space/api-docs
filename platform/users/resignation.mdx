**Best Practices:**

* Users should ensure that all necessary data is exported and any outstanding obligations are settled before submitting their resignation.
* Administrators should process resignation requests promptly and provide feedback or an exit interview if applicable.

**Note:** The resignation process is an important feature for maintaining an accurate member roster and understanding the reasons behind departures, which can inform future retention strategies.
