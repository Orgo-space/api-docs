Orgo's notification system keeps you updated on all the latest activities within your community-driven organization. Notifications alert you to new files added, events created, and other significant updates.

**Notification Alerts**

* **Bell Icon with Badge**: Indicates the number of unread notifications. A red badge with a number, like '7', shows how many new activities await your attention.
